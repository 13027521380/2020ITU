 Hi!we are from Nankai University, China. The project brought by our team is Out of Service(OOS) Alarm Prediction. 
 
(1)In China, there are more than 6 million base stations, which brings huge capital investment including construction cost, operating cost and maintenance cost. China Mobile's total revenue in 2019 was 700 billion, of which one third was used for base station operation and maintenance. In 2021, China will have a 400 billion operation and maintenance market, and the global market will be nearly 1 trillion. So BS investment is increasing year by year.

(2)The traditional maintenance method has the following four steps. Its shortcomings include lacking of real-time performance, high maintenance cost, low efficiency and passive.

(3)The intelligent network maintenance achieves fault prediction through data analysis and continuous self-learning, which can effectively improve processing efficiency and accuracy.Therefore, we propose Base Station Out-of-Service Alarm Prediction. We can build an AI model to predict the probability of out-of-service alarms in the future through minor alarms, which will benefit maintenance personnel to deal with faults in advance and effectively avoid the base station from out-of-service.
